# Sets_Function
Sets of function for machine learning and data science techinque

Sets_Function_Time_Series : Sets of function for time series problem.
- Functions to split the dataset into multiple datasets based on the combination of features
- Function for lagging of multiple feature
- Functions to train the model with multiple train and lag sizes
- Functions for testing and tuning multiple models together
- Functions for ensemble forecasting (average of forecasts from all models)
- Functions to evaluate models with various metrics and select the best ones
I developed these functions during a project for Eni, so for legal issues I had to remove all the data and leave only the functions and process used
